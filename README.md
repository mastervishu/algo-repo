# Algo‑Repo

A curated collection of classic **Algorithms & Data Structures** implementations designed for learners, interview prep, and general reference.

## 🔍 What's Inside

This repository includes:

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists (singly & doubly), Stack, Queue, Hash Table, Heap, Tree (BST, AVL, Red‑Black, Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree), Trie, Disjoint Set (Union‑Find), LRU Cache, Bloom Filter  
- **Algorithms**: Sorting (Quick, Merge, Heap, etc.), Searching (Binary Search), Graph (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, etc.), Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Bit Manipulation, String Algorithms, Math problems (GCD, Sieve of Eratosthenes, Prime tests, etc.)

Each algorithm or structure is implemented in a clean, modular fashion—typically one file per item with explanatory comments and example usage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mastervishu/algo-repo.git
   ```
2. Browse the folders (`data‑structures/`, `algorithms/`, etc.) to explore implementations  
3. Run examples (if applicable):
   ```bash
   # Example
   node algorithms/sort/quick_sort.js
   ```

4. (Optional) Add test cases or integrate into your coding challenges

## 🧠 Why Use This Repo

- **Educational Reference**: Great for understanding standard DSA building blocks.
- **Interview Prep**: Practice implementations similar to common coding interview questions.
- **Self‑Learning**: Develop your algorithmic thinking by going through code and recreating implementations from scratch.

## 📝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork the repo  
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-new-algo`  
3. Add your implementation (with clear comments and tests/examples)  
4. Commit your changes and push your branch  
5. Submit a Pull Request

#### Guidelines:

- One algorithm per file, with comment header explaining:
  - Purpose and description
  - Time & Space complexity
  - Sample usage or simple test
- Follow existing naming conventions & code formatting
- Add/update **README.md** if introducing new high-level categories
