# Algo‑Repo

A curated collection of classic **Algorithms & Data Structures** implementations designed for learners, interview prep, and general reference.

## 🔍 What's Inside

This repository includes:

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists (singly & doubly), Stack, Queue, Hash Table, Heap, Tree (BST, AVL, Red‑Black, Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree), Trie, Disjoint Set (Union‑Find), LRU Cache, Bloom Filter  
- **Algorithms**: Sorting (Quick, Merge, Heap, etc.), Searching (Binary Search), Graph (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, etc.), Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Bit Manipulation, String Algorithms, Math problems (GCD, Sieve of Eratosthenes, Prime tests, etc.)

Each algorithm or structure is implemented in a clean, modular fashion—typically one file per item with explanatory comments and example usage.

## 🚀 Getting Started
